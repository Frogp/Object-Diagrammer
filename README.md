# Object-Diagrammer
This is object diagrammer. Convert .java files to runtime diagram. I hope this is useful for student who learning Java lang.

How to run
1. You need java and javac - install JDK and add path for javac (default location will be C:\Program Files\Java\jdk<version>\bin, add this locatoin to Path)
2. check java, javac ( Windows + R -> cmd -> type java(javac) and run (printed there options than you ready to run)
3. run the make.bat where JavaGrammer (this will be init the project to run)
4. run the run.bat 

How to use 
1. Tool -> reverse and select the java project dir what you want. (if you don't have any java project I insert the sample project in sample directory)
2. just drag and drop from left tree item to right view than you can see the Class's run time Diagram. 
3. also you can add custom class using Tool -> Add custom class. 
4. You can save and load reversed classes and runtime diagram using File -> save, open (sample save file are also included in JavaGrammar directory. Save file have .rcd extention. I recommend open 1_1_Int_LinkedList.rcd for understanding this project.)
